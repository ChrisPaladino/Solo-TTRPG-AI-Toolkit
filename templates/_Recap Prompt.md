Recap Session X: Scene Y for my RPG notes. Use enough detail so that I can understand actions, relationships, feelings, and thoughts if I don't come back to this story for 10 years.

Write the recap in third-person fiction novel style with clear paragraphs, ensuring the summary flows like a well-written high-level novel.

Absolutely DO NOT exceed 20 paragraphs. The moment you hit 20, you stop. If necessary, prioritize clarity, cohesion, and essential plot points over excessive details.
