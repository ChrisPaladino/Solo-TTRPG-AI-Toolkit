# Solo TTRPG AI Toolkit

A series of templates, tips, and tricks to help solo TTRPG players enhance their experience using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok—especially when paired with Mythic Game Emulator (2E) and The Adventure Crafter.
## Introduction

This toolkit is for solo role-players who want to blend traditional solo RPG tools with the power of modern AI. Whether you're crafting scenes, exploring emergent narratives, or managing campaigns with procedural tools like Mythic or Adventure Crafter, this repo will help you get started and stay organized.

## Tips for Using AI
- Offer 3–5 different narrative options to maintain momentum and handle surprises.
- Learn how to steer the AI without railroading or breaking immersion.
- Use prompt formatting effectively for scene creation, NPCs, and twist generation.
- Avoid triggering content filters when working with dark, mature, or sensitive themes—we'll show you how to keep it tasteful and context-aware.
## Templates
Quick-reference templates for key elements of solo RPG play:
- Scene framing

All templates are optimized for AI interaction and Markdown editing.
## Best Practices with AI
Tips to keep your AI partner consistent, immersive, and helpful:
- Use role-based prompts ("You are a gritty narrator in a sword & sorcery world...")
- Maintain a session history for better context and memory
- Use summary blurbs to quickly remind the AI of past events or character motivations
