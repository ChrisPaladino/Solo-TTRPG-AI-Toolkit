# Solo TTRPG AI Toolkit
A series of templates, tips, and tricks to help solo TTRPG players enhance their experience using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok—especially when paired with Mythic Game Emulator (2E) and The Adventure Crafter.
## Introduction
This toolkit is for solo role-players who want to blend traditional solo RPG tools with the power of modern AI. Whether you're crafting scenes, exploring emergent narratives, or managing campaigns with procedural tools like Mythic or Adventure Crafter, this repo will help you get started and stay organized.

## How to Get Started (No Coding Required)
You don’t need to know anything about programming to use this toolkit. Follow these steps to get started:
### Step 1: Download the Toolkit
1. Go to the green **"Code"** button on this page.
2. Click **"Download ZIP"**.
3. Save the file somewhere on your computer (like your Desktop or Documents folder).

### Step 2: Unzip the Folder
1. Find the `.zip` file you just downloaded.
2. Right-click it and choose **"Extract All"** (or double-click to unzip it).
3. This will create a new folder called `Solo-TTRPG-AI-Toolkit`.
### Step 3: Open the Templates
1. Open the folder.
2. Go to the `templates` folder inside.
3. Double-click any `.md` file to open it in a text editor:
    - Use **Notepad**, **Obsidian**, or **any Markdown viewer**.
    - You don’t need special software to view or copy the prompts.
### Step 4: Use a Template in AI
1. Open your AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok).
2. Copy the full text from one of the `.md` files.
3. Paste it into the chat with your AI.
4. Follow any bracketed instructions or leave them blank for improvisation.
## Who This Is For
This toolkit is ideal for solo roleplayers, writers, and GMs who want to:
- Create deep, immersive stories without a group
- Blend traditional solo RPG tools with modern AI assistance
- Stay organized while improvising worlds, characters, and conflicts
- Use procedural systems like Mythic GME and the Adventure Crafter more effectively
## Getting Started
A quick primer on setting up your first AI-enhanced solo RPG session using:
- AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.)
- Mythic Game Emulator 2E by Tanya Pigeon
- The Adventure Crafter by Tanya Pigeon
## Tips for Using AI
- Offer 3–5 different narrative options to maintain momentum and handle surprises.
- Learn how to steer the AI without railroading or breaking immersion.
- Use prompt formatting effectively for scene creation, NPCs, and twist generation.
- Avoid triggering content filters when working with dark, mature, or sensitive themes—we'll show you how to keep it tasteful and context-aware.
## Templates
Each Markdown file in the `/templates` folder is a pre-structured AI prompt, ready to drop into your preferred AI tool. These are designed to make solo TTRPG gameplay smoother, deeper, and more creative—especially when using procedural tools like Mythic GME or the Adventure Crafter.

|Template File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`_Prompt Faction.md`|Creates political or mystical factions with clear goals and conflicts|
|`_Prompt GM.md`|Establishes genre, tone, and narrative voice for the AI GM|
|`_Prompt Image.md`|Provides prompts for visualizing characters, items, or places|
|`_Prompt Location.md`|Develops atmospheric and story-rich settings or regions|
|`_Prompt Monster.md`|Designs thematic adversaries with narrative hooks|
|`_Prompt NPC.md`|Generates interesting, three-dimensional NPCs with agendas and quirks|
|`_Prompt Recap.md`|Summarizes the previous session in character or narrator voice|
|`_Prompt Vehicle.md`|Designs a vehicle, or class of vehicles including narrative hooks and named uniques|
|`_Scene Altered.md`|Rewrites or reframes a current scene based on new context or twists|
## How to Use the Templates
1. **Choose a Template**  
    Browse the `/templates` directory and select a Markdown file based on what you need: a new NPC, a monster, a recap, a faction, etc.
2. **Copy into an AI Tool**  
    Open your preferred AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok). Copy and paste the full template into the input field.
3. **Fill in Brackets or Leave Blank**  
    Templates use `[bracketed]` placeholders. You can fill them in for more control or leave them blank to let the AI improvise.
4. **Review the Output**  
    Edit or iterate as needed. Many prompts can be reused multiple times in a single session.
5. **Optional**: Store results in Obsidian or a similar Markdown editor for campaign tracking.
These templates are system-agnostic and can be adapted to fit any solo RPG structure, from narrative-heavy games like _Ironsworn_ to sandbox kits like _Freeform Universal_.
## Best Practices with AI
Tips to keep your AI partner consistent, immersive, and helpful:
- Use role-based prompts ("You are a gritty narrator in a sword & sorcery world...")
- Maintain a session history for better context and memory
- Use summary blurbs to quickly remind the AI of past events or character motivations
