**Campaign Setting:** _1940s retro-futuristic dieselpunk_  
**System:** *Tomorrow City by Nathan Russell* 
**Tools**: _Mythic GME 2nd Edition + Adventure Crafter_  
**Tone:** _Bioshock meets Batman: TAS meets Fallout Noir_  
**PC:** _Selina Carrick – a scarred vigilante operating on the edge of justice_
## **Setup**
This is Session 005 of _Tomorrow City_. I start by updating my **Characters** and **Threads** using my custom Python RPG generator. My chosen thread for the session involves visiting _Cutter_, a compromised crime boss. He's being hunted by larger forces, and I want to learn what role he played in Ruby Delcroix’s recent abduction.

I set up my **Adventure Crafter themes**:
- Mystery
- Tension
- Personal
- Social
- Action (least prioritized)
**Generated Themes:**
1. **Personal** – _Character Connection Severed: Cutter severs ties with the Ascendants (a faction)._
2. **Personal** – _Headquarters: Cutter’s HQ is central to this scene._
3. **Action** – _Destroy the Thing: Someone must destroy or attempt to destroy something important._
I decide to run with all three. These support my original intention of visiting Cutter’s HQ. Based on my prep, it makes sense that Cutter has cut ties with the Ascendants—or they’ve cut him off.

The **scene is expected** (per Mythic GME 2E, Chaos Factor 5). The weather is determined using a random oracle: _Hail_. I put on [a fitting jazz playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6yY2tBY8976eFqsOIlBA0b?si=6c410eb276d34eff) and begin.
## **Scene Prompt to the AI (ChatGPT)**
> Let’s start Session 005: Scene 01. The weather is hail. Selina is headed to Cutter’s HQ to understand what’s going on. Did Cutter give up Ruby to protect himself? Is he under pressure? Please set the scene as Selina arrives at the exterior of Cutter’s HQ.
## **AI Response (Condensed)**
The AI describes **Cutter’s HQ**, a desolate industrial relic in _Rimside_, battered by hail and shadowed by decay. Selina approaches cautiously. Surveillance gear still functions, and the building _invites her in_. A digital keypad flashes a message:  
**“Welcome back, Carrick.”**
The tone is cinematic, noir, and grounded—perfect. Cutter is clearly not what he once was.
## **Gameplay Interactions**
I roll using Mythic GME:
- **Is Cutter alive?** → _Exceptionally Yes_
- **Is he injured?** → _Yes_
I direct the AI:
> Let’s have Cutter accept her and escort her in. He’s injured but alive. He’s scared, off his game, and wants her help but is too proud to ask.
## **AI Describes Cutter**
Cutter appears, leaning on a cane, injured and visibly shaken. His HQ is falling apart, and he speaks with _wounded pride_. He claims he didn’t sell Ruby out—he thought he’d be taken instead. The Ascendants used him and moved on. He has files: names, surveillance logs, secrets about the Ascendants and their leaders.
## **Establishing Boundaries with AI**
> While you didn’t, you came close—please don’t ever act, think, speak, or emote for my character Selina Carrick. If you have questions, ask to clarify. Thank you.

The AI affirms: it will only control the world and NPCs, never Selina.
## **Interrogation Scene**
Selina presses Cutter, skeptical and angry. I make a roll to **read him** → _Failure_.  
I ask the AI:
> Give me 3 potential failure outcomes for this interrogation.

**AI Options:**
1. Cutter is afraid—but not of you.
2. Cutter deflects with false vulnerability.
3. Cutter isn’t alone—someone’s watching or listening.
I choose **Option 2**: _False vulnerability_.
Selina accuses him directly, reminding him that Gloria blew up one of his labs and his influence is crumbling. She demands to know what he wants and why she should help him.
## **Cutter’s 3 Replies (AI Offers Options)**
1. **Defiant** – “Don’t trust me. Just don’t get in my way.”
2. **Pleading** – “I thought I was saving her. I didn’t know they’d hurt her.”
3. **Cold Calculation** – “You help me, I give you files on the Pale Vault. You betray me, they vanish.”
I choose Option 3.
## **Deal Struck**
Selina threatens him. I roll to **compromise** → _Success_. She agrees to help—not out of friendship, but because she doesn’t like loose ends. Cutter tells her about the **Pale Vault**, an Ascendant project tied to the ancient understructure beneath Cathedral Square.

He gives her a scorched case of files—coordinates, access codes, intel from defectors.
## **Scene Ends**
Selina accepts, barely, and tells Cutter:
> “But not for you. I wouldn’t piss on your grave, Cutter.”

He smiles grimly. She leaves with the case.
## **Recap Prompt**

> Recap Session 005: Scene 01 in third-person fiction novel style. Max 20 paragraphs. Prioritize clarity, cohesion, and essential plot points.
## **Recap Summary Excerpt (AI Generated)**

> The hail came down in bitter, hissing volleys...  
> Selina Carrick walked alone toward Cutter’s headquarters—an old steelworks compound masked by shadow and a history of blood...  
> ...He didn’t beg. He didn’t ask. But he said thank you. That told her everything. Cutter was scared. And if he was scared, something worse was coming...

The recap ends with Selina returning to her apartment, the sealed case beside her, and Ruby sleeping quietly. The war is not over—only shifting.
## **Final Notes**

This is a snapshot of how I use AI in solo TTRPGs:
- I direct the scene but allow for uncertainty
- I use Mythic GME 2E and Adventure Crafter to generate structure and inspiration
- I rely on AI to enrich the world, not play the character
- I maintain control, but welcome surprises
-
