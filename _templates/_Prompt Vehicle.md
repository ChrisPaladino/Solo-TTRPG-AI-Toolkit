Please create a vehicle profile with these header sections. In each section, write in paragraph form - not just bullet points. Use Markup Heading Level 5 (#####) for each of these sections, but no other text formatting (no BOLD, no ITALICS).
* Description: include the vehicle's visual design, propulsion system, color scheme, overall shape and scale, and the impression it gives. Consider the sound it makes when idle or in motion, its onboard systems, any visible weapons or markings, and the aesthetic philosophy behind its construction (industrial, ceremonial, biological, magical, etc). Include anything that gives it unique character in the world.
* AI Appearance: a stripped-down description of the vehicle’s visual look based ONLY on physical appearance and components. This field will be used to create the vehicle consistently in AI-Generated art programs.
